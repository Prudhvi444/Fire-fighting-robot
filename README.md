Fire-fighting is an important but dangerous occupation. A fire-fighter must be able to get to a fire quickly and safely extinguish the fire, preventing further damage and reduce fatalities. Technology has finally bridged the gap between fire fighting and machines allowing for a more efficient and effective method of fire fighting. Robots designed to find a fire, before it rages out of control, could one day work with fire fighters greatly reducing the risk of injury to victims.
